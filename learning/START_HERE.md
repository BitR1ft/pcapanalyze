## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Go Sequential** - Sessions build on each other
2. **Code Along** - Type code yourself, don't copy-paste
3. **Practice** - Do exercises at end of each session
4. **Test Often** - Run code after each section
5. **Take Breaks** - Complex topics need time to absorb
6. **Ask Questions** - Create GitHub issues if stuck
